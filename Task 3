#Used arithmetic operator addition to calculate users input for swimming, cycling and running and stored as total_time
#Used if, elif statement to execute suitable award, skipped else statement as all possible conditions is covered
#Used logical operator 'and' so both conditions are met to execute message 
#Used comparison operators to compare values
